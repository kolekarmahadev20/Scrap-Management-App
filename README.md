**Scrap Management App** is a Flutter-based industrial application built to digitize and streamline the process of recording, validating, and approving scrap material in a manufacturing or warehouse environment. The system replaces manual registers and error-prone calculations with a structured digital workflow that ensures accuracy, traceability, and real-time visibility for both operators and approvers. Users can enter scrap data through a clean and intuitive interface, making the daily scrap-handling process fast and reliable.

At the core of the application is a strong validation and calculation engine. Users enter the First Weight and Gross Weight, and the system automatically calculates the Net Weight while enforcing strict rules that prevent invalid data from being submitted. Gross weight must always be greater than the first weight, and negative or incorrect values are blocked at the UI level. This logic ensures that all scrap records stored in the system are accurate and ready for auditing or reporting without requiring manual corrections.

The approval workflow is fully integrated into the system. Every scrap entry submitted by a user is immediately sent to the approver, who can review, approve, or reject the request. Approvers receive pop-up notifications for every new request, and users receive a single-time status pop-up whenever their request is approved or rejected. All requests remain permanently visible in the system, ensuring that no data is lost and that both parties have a complete history of all scrap transactions.

From the beginning, the app started as a simple form-based system, but it has evolved into a fully production-ready platform. Live synchronization was added so that users and approvers always see the same data in real time. Popup control logic was implemented to avoid duplicate alerts and ensure clear communication. GitHub was integrated for proper version control, collaboration, and deployment tracking, and Shorebird was added to enable hot updates without requiring users to reinstall the app.

Today, the Scrap Management App stands as a robust, secure, and scalable solution that improves operational efficiency, reduces errors, and provides full transparency across the entire scrap management lifecycle.
